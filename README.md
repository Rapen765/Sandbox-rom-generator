# Sandbox ROM Generator
## How to use it?
Firstly, download the '''sandbox.exe''' file and run it. You should see an empty text input and two buttons.

In the input, you can write any math expression with variables 'a' and 'b', which are the first input and the second input.

Then click "Generate" and copy the result. In the game, click on the ROM and press Ctrl+V to paste.
